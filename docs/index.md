## About Mega Bomberman
Mega Bomberman is an action and maze game launched the 10th of December of 1993 under the name of Bomberman '94 for the TurboGrafx-16 exclussively in Japan. Some months later, the 11th of October of 1994 it was released in USA and Europe as Mega Bomberman for the Sega Genesis and Mega Drive.

In this game you take the role of the main character of the story, "Bomberman". The story takes place in a moment of war and dispute. While Planet Bomber lived in peace and under the protection of five spirits, Buglear (the villian of the game) and his Robot Army invaded the planet and the Spirit Pictures where destroyed and so did the magical powers of the spirits. Now Planet Bomber is divided into five pieces and Bomberman's mission is to restore the Spirit Pictures and bring peace back again to the planet.

### Gameplay mechanics
Boberman has the power of dropping bombs around the map, these bombs can either break obstacles (which block the path for Bomberman to walk through) to let Bomberman move around the entire map or kill enemies what will harm and get one of Bomberman's 3 lives. To advance to the next level, the player must be able to destroy all of the orbs that are located around the map, again, with his bombs. Once the orbs are broken he will be able to scape. The game ends with a boss battle against Saru and Bananacher.
